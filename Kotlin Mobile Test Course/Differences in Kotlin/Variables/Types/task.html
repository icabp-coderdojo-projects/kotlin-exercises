<h1>Variable types</h1>
When working with Javascript or Python, you may have heard of the term 'type', for example: <br><br>
<code>"Example"</code> is a <code>String</code><br>
<code>16</code> is an <code>Integer</code><br>
<code>[2, 3, 4]</code> is an <code>Array</code>
<br><br>
and so on, for all 'types' of data we want to store
<br><br>
Types are important when programming because our programs need to know what to do with data.
We can't add an integer the same way we add a string
<div class="hint">
  You might have seen this if you ever tried adding <code>1 + 1</code>, or <code>"1" + "1"</code> in Javascript or Python
  <br>
  In the first case, we get <code>2</code>, but in the second case, we get <code>"11"</code> <br><br>
  This is because strings could be <code>"Hello"</code>, and <code>"world"</code>, and when we add them we want to get <code>"Hello world"</code>
  <br><br>
  It looks confusing because we see numbers inside our string, but they are also a <code>String</code> type, and get added the same way
  <br><br>
  This behaviour is because of types, which each variable is secretly given when you create it
</div>
<h1>Soft typed vs. Hard typed</h1>
Some languages are called <code>soft typed</code> languages. <br>
These languages will handle the types of variables for you
<br>
&nbsp;- Javascript and Python are <code>soft typed</code>
<br><br>
Other languages are called <code>hard typed</code> languages, which do not handle variable types.
<br>
&nbsp;- Kotlin is <code>hard typed</code>
<br><br>
For example:
<pre><code>
  function add(x, y) {
    let result = x;
    for(i=0; i < y; i++) {
      result++;
    }
    return result;
  }
</code></pre>
works in Javascript for any two integers, the same function in Kotlin looks like (also in the Task.kt file):
<pre><code>
  fun add(x: Int, y: Int): Int {
    var result = x
    for(i in 0 until y) {
        result++
    }
    return result
  }
</code></pre>
This is very bad code (and you should never write it), but works as an example
<br><br>
<b>Try giving our Kotlin function a <code>String</code> for <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, or both</b>, and see what happens
<br><br>
You can also try the Javascript function in the Chrome/Firefox console if you want, or just look at the hint below:
<div class="hint">
  <pre><code>
    >>add(1, 2)
    - 3
    >>add("Hello", "world")
    - "Hello"
    >>add(4, "world")
    - 4
  </code></pre>
</div>
As you can see, in Kotlin our function will either work or give an error, but in Javascript it will always try run, giving us the <i>wrong output without warning</i> because of it handling types for us
<br><br>
This is one reason some people prefer <code>hard typed</code> over <code>soft typed</code>, but both types of language have many benefits and downsides to consider
